## Mission objectives

- Be able to connect to data stored in a SQL database.
- Be able to use SQL to perform relevant and efficient queries on the database.
- Be able to think outside the box.
- Be able to find and answer creative questions about data.
- Be able to bring business insights based on data.


## The Mission

You are a data analysis consultant at a big company that has just migrated their data to a **SQL DB**. Your mission is to help the company find business insights from the data that will help them grow their business.

They provide you this [SQL DB](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QWmV2YQ9dBx3J6asLEb3e_lpjDIrUb-f/view?usp=drive_link).

It consists of a database of all the active companies in Belgium and it contains information about their address, contact details, activities, establishments... Note that these data come from [public open data](https://economie.fgov.be/en/themes/enterprises/crossroads-bank-enterprises/services-everyone/public-data-available-reuse/cbe-open-data)

Your primary focus will be writing SQL queries to analyze this data and extract meaningful business insights. While you can use visualization tools like Streamlit to present your findings, the core of your work should be developing insightful SQL queries that help understand business patterns and trends.

You will have to create a short slidedeck to present your findings.

### Must-have features

- Write SQL queries to analyze the database and extract meaningful business insights.
- You must write at least 10 SQL queries that demonstrate your analytical skills and bring value. Some examples of questions to explore:
    - Which percentage of companies are under which juridical form? 
    - What is the distribution of company statuses?
    - Calculate average company age by sector (NACE codes)
    - Track company creation trends over time with time-based analysis
    - Compare geographical distribution of companies
    - Find growth trends by sector with year-over-year analysis
    - Detect seasonal patterns for company creation
    - Create your own analytical queries that showcase advanced SQL concepts like:
        - Complex joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
        - CASE statements
        - Date/time functions
        - Aggregate functions
        - GROUP BY 
        - ORDER BY
        - ...
- Create a 5-8 slides presentation to showcase your insights by using professional storytelling techniques (Problem statement, answer, conclusion)

### Nice-to-have features

You can showcase your insights in your slides using impactful visualizations created with your preferred tool (Excel, Plotly, or any other)
Alternatively, you may choose to develop a Streamlit app or an interactive dashboard with tools like Power BI or Tableau.
